Stages of grief

The taste of freedom you achieve
By only going trough all stages

At first you try to feel the brezze
Ignoring every single message
That in your head right now appears
It's gonna be you little cage now

You start to panic and the brezze
Is turning into the tornando
That blows away each single piece
Sincerely kept inside your head oh

With nothing left your only choice
Appears like simpliest decision
Why hadn't you come with it first
This shape is taking on your vision
You take the bottle of shampaine 
The light behind the curtains. PAIN
So suddenely hits ya

But maybe this is not the end 
I've should've texted at her back
The alchochol inside now hits you
You lay down and now it's pinch black

The dreams you see
With her and your reflection
The both of you are so happily in that painting
The mirror breaks and suddenly 
You wake up to the world 
only
Without her beside your back and pain goes on
it isn't gone but deeply burried in you

this shouldnt be here
